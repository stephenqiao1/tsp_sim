# Unity TSP Algorithm Viewer

# Overview
This project is a Unity-based application that visualizes various algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It provides a graphical interface to place cities on a 2D grid and then run different algorithms to find the shortest path that visits all cities.

Features
- Algorithms Supported: Brute Force, Nearest Neighbor, and Ant Colony Optimization.
- Interactive UI: Place cities on the grid and choose the algorithm to run.
- Real-time Visualization: Watch the algorithm in action, visualizing the paths being considered.
- Performance Metrics: View the length of the current path, the shortest path found, and the number of paths checked.

Usage
1. Placing Cities: Use the UI to place cities on the grid.
2. Select Algorithm: Choose the algorithm you want to run from the dropdown.
3. Start Algorithm: Click the "Start" button to run the algorithm.
4. Pause/Resume: The "Start" button toggles to "Pause" once the algorithm starts running. Click again to pause.
5. Clear: Clears the grid and all paths.
